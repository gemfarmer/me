The National Science Foundation has a little known resource – The Small Business Innovation Research fund. Through SBIR, the NSF provides equity free seedfunding to startups that have the potential to radically shift industries. Our goal was to create a site that startups would find more attractive and easier to navigate than the existing documentation on NSF’s site.
