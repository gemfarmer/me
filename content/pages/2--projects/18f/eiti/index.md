The Extractives Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) is a global standard that promotes open and accountable management of natural resources. We worked with  Deloitte and the Department of the Interior (DoI), the U.S. agency that manages public federal lands and administers “extractive” leases (such as oil, gas, and mining), to develop a web version of America’s first EITI report.

In 2017, the US withdrew from EITI, but the site is maintained by a team at DoI.
