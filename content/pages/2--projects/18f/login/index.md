### My Roles
My roles were split between writing Rails code for the security application ([secure.login.gov](https://secure.login.gov)) and Jekyll for the front-facing site ([www.login.gov](https://www.login.gov)). I helped implement a styleguide using Fractal, that both sites enherited styles from. This helped promote a unified style without having to maintain multiple codebases.


### Tools Used
Ruby on Rails, Jekyll, Fractal, Bass CSS
