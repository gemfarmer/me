A few years ago I was caught in the SPA frenzy that took over the JS world. MVC frameworkds like Angular and Backbone had solved all sorts of problems that had plagued front end developers for years. As a JS dev, fullstack JS made a lot of sense to me – and I had fun building SPA or SPA-like apps for a time.

This changed for me with the arrival of ES6 in 2015. Don't get me wrong, I really loved a lot of the improvements over ES5. The arrival of modules (and being able to abandon AMD loaders like RequireJS), class syntax, and the shift towards promises have been huge! But I didn't like the JS ecosystem at the time.

But in some ways it felt like the arrival of ES6 made apps a bit more complicated to maintain without adding much substance. Every application required a whole suite of `babel-` packages just to transpile your ES6 code to ES5. I found myself frequently reverting to ES5 in sections just to avoid unfixed transpiler bugs.

So, I decided to take a brief haitus from JS and dive into Ruby more fully.

### How I felt about Ruby in 2016

I had worked with Rails before, but I hadn't really had much interest in exploring it fully. In fact, two of my recent projects were migration projects – Rails to Node.js. Compared to the JS community, the Rails community felt outdated and stale. As a framework, Rails often felt overly-opinionated. `rails new` generated a fairly fleshed out application compared to express or koa. Also the "convention over configuration" paradigm bothered me. What if I didn't want to structure my application that way? Ironically, my favorite MVC framework was Angular, which followed a similar doctrine.

But I was ready for a change.

### Sprowt Labs on Rails

For the last two years I have been working on a set of Rails application for Sprowt Labs. Coupled with an (unnamed) IoT PaaS company, the apps form the backbone of the company's IoT infrastructure, directly interacting with companies and a fleet of devices in the field.

Despite having more experience with Node and JS frameworks at the time, I chose to use Rails for a few reasons:

1. **My coding time would be limited.** The JS ecosystem was moving too fast for my confort. The more compelling technologies like React were too bleeding edge to rely on and many of the year old technologies were being abandoned for React and other shiny things.
1. **Rails is robust.** Whatever beef you have with Rails, you cannot deny that it is full-service. There truly is a gem for most things, and many of them are well-tested and battle-worn.
1. **A lot of people know Rails.** The JS world was (and still is) quite splintered compared ot the Ruby world. Sure, some rubyists use Sinatra or write plain scripts, but most use Rails. If Sprowt needed to hire more engineers, we likely could find someone in our area.



#### Upsides

#### Downsides
1. **Rails is syncronyous, and can't fully utilize** I wasn't too concerned about this, my thoughts being well expressed by [DHH, co-creator of Rails](https://dhh.dk/). To paraphrase: "Do you even have 400 requests a second? No? - Then who cares? Yes? - Buy another CPU. Hardware is cheap, programmer time and suffering is expensive. If you really, really, really need performance later, worry about it then.".
  * The problem here is that with our devices out in the field we sometimes do get 200+ requests a second for hours on end. I've handled most of these surges with Redis and Sidekiq, but the basic pain point still remains.
