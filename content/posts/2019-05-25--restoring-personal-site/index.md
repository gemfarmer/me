Keeping a private site is something that I've meant to do for awhile, but something generally got in the way. Maintaining a site takes time and I tend to be a private person, so sharing too many of my thoughts and tid bits about my life is a bit unnerving.

I'm doing this because I want to learn in public, because I think it is a powerful way to keep yourself accountable.

### Thanks to @greglobinski
This site is made using a [Gatsby starter](https://github.com/greglobinski/gatsby-starter-personal-blog) by [@greglobinski](https://github.com/greglobinski). He did the bulk of the work so that I didn't have to. Thanks, Greg!
