Starting my own company has tested almost every aspect of my character. Working as an employee can be difficult and trying as well, but I know that I personally haven't felt the same emotional investment and general engagement as I have at Sprowt.

A few major aspects stand out to me: **Project management**, **Working with partners**, and **Maintaining a personal life**.

## Project management
I had experience working remotely before Sprowt. I had worked remotely, managing my own schedule most days, and largely working independently. It required self control to stay productive, not get distracted at home, and to maintain normal work hours.

### Own boss, own schedule
Starting a company has many similar challenges, but with some extra kinks.

For starters, there are so many things to get done all the time, it can be easy to overwork. You may have heard the following saying:

> "When you are your own boss, you can work whenever you want...as long as you are _always_ working."

The flip side is maintaining momentum and morale. Because, while there is always work to be done, it can be tough to want to keep going after a long day or tough week.

And, because launching a product takes awhile, we paced ourselves, generally restricting working to a 5 day week, with 9-10 hour days – not insane at all by startup standards.

### Managing family and friends

### Long days

### Exercise


### Scoping, prioritization, and maintaining focus
When you have too many things to do, prioritization is key. Agile teams often use the concept of a _Sprint_ to manage time and and organize tasks. We have used a similar approach, prioritizing and assigning work in 2-4 week _"Quests"_. Each quest has a _Quest Planning_ to organize and prioritize what needs to be done, and a _Quest Retro_ (short for Retroactive) to reflect on what happened in the last quest, and a check in on how we are feeling.

While the _Planning_ session sounds more important, it is my experience that the _Retro_ is equally vital. Having a dedicated time for reflection is a good opportunity both to celebrate victories (in an endless marathon of work), err interpersonal grievances before they fester, and redirect work before going too far down the wrong path. I cannot stress this enough. A former 18F co-worker once said

> "There are two kinds of teams: teams that Retro, and teams that don't Retro."

I see why. _Frequent_ reflection is key to maintaining a healthy startup.


## Handling stress and uncertainty
When I joined Christopher in the adventure of Sprowt, I had no idea what was going to happen – it was exciting! The future was bright, and we were focusing on the big picture. We had no idea how long it would take to launch our product, but optimism was in the air.

Things have become less clear since. I have found starting a business to be unbelievably stressful. It is a rollercoaster of success and failure, hope and dread, the lingering anxiety of an uncertain future.

## Working with partners

I've found that working with partners is one of the most helpful ways to manage some of the stresses of entrepreneurship.

### Accountability

### Interpersonal conflict


<!-- ### Morale -->
